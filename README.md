MZBench helps software testers and developers test their products under high real life load. By testing your product with MZBench before going to production, you reduce the risk of outages under real life highload.

MZBench runs test scenarios on many machines simultaneous, maintaining millions of connections, which make it suitable even for large scale products.

MZBench is:

 - **Cloud-aware:** MZBench can allocates nodes directly from Amazon EC2 or run on a local machine.
 - **Scalable:** tested with 100 nodes and millions of connections.
 - **Extendable:** write your own [cloud plugins](doc/cloud_plugins.md#how-to-write-a-cloud-plugin) and [workers](doc/workers.md#how-to-write-a-worker).
 - **Open-source:** MZBench is released under the [BSD license](https://github.com/machinezone/mzbench/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Protocols

Out-of-the-box it supports [HTTP](workers/http), [MySQL](workers/mysql), [PostgreSQL](workers/pgsql), [MongoDB](workers/mongo), [Cassandra](workers/cassandra), [XMPP](workers/xmpp), [AMQP](workers/amqp), [TCP](workers/tcp), [Shell commands execution](workers/exec), [Simplified HTTP](workers/simple_http), and [TCPKali](workers/tcpkali).

Implementing addtional protocols is [not that hard](doc/workers.md#how-to-write-a-worker), but if you want something particular to be implemented — feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/machinezone/mzbench/issues).

## Installation

### From RPM and Pip

Available for CentOS 7 and Amazon Linux.

Download MZBench RPM from [Github releases page](https://github.com/machinezone/mzbench/releases)

```bash
# Install RPM
sudo yum install -y <rpm_file_downloaded_from_github_releases>

# Install Python package
sudo pip install mzbench_api_client

# Start the server
mzbench start_server
```

### From Docker container

Docker is a container platform, more information is available at its [website](https://www.docker.com/). If you have Docker up and running, use the following command to start MZBench server:

```bash
docker run -d -p 4800:80 --name mzbench_server docker.io/ridrisov/mzbench
```

After that, open http://localhost:4800/ to see the dashboard. Sources for this docker image are available on [github](https://github.com/machinezone/mzbench/tree/master/docker).

### From sources

To use MZBench, you'll need:

 - Erlang R17+
 - C++ compiler
 - Python 2.6 or 2.7 with pip

Download MZBench from GitHub and install Python requirements:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/machinezone/mzbench
$ sudo pip install -r mzbench/requirements.txt
```

If you want to use virtualenv (optional) to isolate Python dependencies:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/machinezone/mzbench
$ cd mzbench
$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quickstart

Start the MZBench server on localhost:

```bash
$ cd mzbench
$ ./bin/mzbench start_server
Executing make -C /path/to//mzbench/bin/../server generate
Executing /path/to//mzbench/bin/../server/_build/default/rel/mzbench_api/bin/mzbench_api start
```

When the server is running, launch an example benchmark:

```bash
$ ./bin/mzbench run examples.bdl/ramp.bdl
{
    "status": "pending",
    "id": 6
}
status: running                       00:09
```

Go to [localhost:4800](http://localhost:4800) and see the benchmark live status:
